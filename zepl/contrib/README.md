# Contributed code

This is the home of various potentially useful user contributed extensions and
for zepl.vim.  Nothing here is enabled by default; individual extensions can be
enabled as desired.

Typically these extensions can be enabled like so:

```vim
runtime zepl/contrib/load_files.vim
```

Documentation for each of these extensions can be accessed from the `:help
zepl-contrib.txt` help doc after installing zepl.vim.

As zepl.vim aims to contain no language-specific code in core, these extensions
provide an easy mechanism to add extra featues and support for languages with
unusual syntax such as Python (`:help zepl-python`).
