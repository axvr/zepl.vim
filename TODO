* Next
  - Add GIF to README.

* Maybe
  - Maybe make the bufnr publicly accessible (but locked).
  - Add multiple REPL support.
    - Vim prompt asking which REPL to use.
    - Set 'cmd' to a list of strings, or set 'cmd' to a Vim function.
      - The function can then do the prompting and ask for additional info.
    - In contrib?
